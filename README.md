# Reader
A Microsub reader. To be used in tandem with, e.g., [Aperture](https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture).

Built on Laravel 7, I believe, it was _heavily_ inspired by [Monocle](https://github.com/aaronpk/Monocle) and contains a small amount of WordPress code, hence the GPL(-compatible) licenseâ€”although I'm by no means an expert when it comes to these things.

I seem to be packaging a version of my own [laravel-imageproxy](https://github.com/janboddez/laravel-imageproxy), too, as well as a fork of [aaronpk/p3k-html-sanitizer](https://github.com/aaronpk/p3k-html-sanitizer).

I'm putting this up here for reference but will immediately archive this repo, as I've since started yet another feed reader project, one that takes a bit of a different approach.
